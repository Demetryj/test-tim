              <p class="with-space">
                The Wachanga, Wachanga Apps and Services are United States-based services. However,
                because access to the Wachanga Website, Wachanga Apps and Services may use the
                internet infrastructure of different jurisdictions, use of the Wachanga Website,
                Wachanga Apps and Services may be subject to the laws of various jurisdictions,
                including the laws of the United States and the European Union. For example,
                personally identifiable information collected in the European Union and its Member
                States is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
              </p>

              <p class="with-space">
                Wachanga may disclose your personally identifiable information without your prior
                affirmative consent if it has a good-faith belief that disclosure is reasonably
                necessary to meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable
                governmental request or to investigate or protect against harmful activities to
                Wachanga’s guests, users, associates, or property or to others. We may also disclose
                personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing
                this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against
                someone who may be violating this Privacy Policy, the terms of their agreements with
                the Wachanga (such as the Terms of Service), or to protect the safety of our users
                and the public. We may also disclose personally identifiable information under
                confidentiality and licensing agreements with certain third parties who assist us in
                developing, operating and maintaining the Wachanga Website, Wachanga Apps and
                Services, including the content therein.
              </p>

              <p>
                Wachanga may also be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide
                personally identifiable information to appropriate governmental authorities. If
                requested by law enforcement or judicial authorities, Wachanga will provide this
                information upon receipt of appropriate documentation. Wachanga may also provide
                information to law enforcement to protect its property and the health and safety of
                individuals as permitted by statute.

                When you use the Website, Wachanga Apps or Services, Wachanga or trusted third
                parties authorized by Wachanga may collect certain technical and routing information
                about your computer (also known as environmental variables). When you browse the

                Google Chrome, or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits information
                to Wachanga each time you access content on one of our internet domains. Examples of
                such information include the URL of the particular web page you visited, your
                computer’s IP (Internet Protocol) address, and your Internet browser version. We
                collect this information in order to make the Website, Wachanga Apps and Services
                function properly and provide you the Website’s functionality. We also use this
                information to better understand how visitors use the Website, Wachanga Apps and
                Services and how we can better adjust the Website, Wachanga Apps or Services, their
                contents, and functionality to meet the needs of our users. However, this
                information is not associated with any personally identifiable information.

                Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to help website operators
                understand how visitors interact with their websites. A web beacon is typically a
                transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. As
                opposed to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons
                are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end
                of this sentence. These web beacons are not tied to personally identifiable
                information. The use of web beacons allows the site to measure the actions of the
                visitor opening the page that contains the web beacon. It makes it easier to follow
                and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited
                at a website. Wachanga uses the information provided by web beacons to develop a
                better understanding of how the Website’s visitors use the Website and to facilitate
                those visitors' interactions with the Website. Wachanga may make the aggregate data
                obtained from web analytics (including from our third-party analytics providers, if
                applicable) publicly available. If this data is made available, none of the
                information will be personally identifying information or potentially-personally
                identifying information.

                Wachanga is committed to protecting the security of your personally identifiable
                information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help
                protect your personal information. Wachanga operates secure data networks protected
                by industry-standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and
                privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only
                authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users.
                Wachanga takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in
                accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the
                Internet can be guaranteed secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your
                personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you
                transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you use these services

                regarding the protection and use of confidential information. After personally
                identifiable information reaches Wachanga, it is stored on a server with physical
                and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization
                of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized
                access from outside of Wachanga. Because laws applicable to personal information
                vary by country, our offices or other business operations may put in place
                additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements.
                Information collected on the sites covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and
                stored in the United States and possibly other jurisdictions and also in other
